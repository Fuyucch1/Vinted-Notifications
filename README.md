### Telegram Commands

After configuring your Telegram bot in the Web UI, you can use the following commands:

- `/add_query query` - Add a search query to monitor
- `/remove_query query_number` - Remove a specific query
- `/remove_query all` - Remove all queries
- `/queries` - List all active queries
- `/hello` - Check if the bot is working
- `/create_allowlist` - Create a country allowlist (will slow down processing)

   ```
